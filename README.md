# Budgetting

I am an avid traveler who wishes to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data connection or internet connection. In order to keep my account balance accurate while I'm traveling

When entering an expense or deposit into a budget tracker without an internet connection. Upon reestablishing an internet connection, the user will be notified that they have added an expense or deposit. They will then be able to see their transaction history and their totals updated.
